      abstract={Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. Recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine within the Muon algorithm for training deep neural networks. However, the requirements of this application differ sharply from classical settings: deep learning demands GPU-friendly algorithms that prioritize high throughput over high precision. We introduce Polar Express, a new method for computing the polar decomposition. Like Newton-Schulz and other classical polynomial methods, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it very efficient on GPUs. Inspired by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem. We prove that this strategy minimizes error in a worst-case sense, allowing Polar Express to converge as rapidly as possible both in the early iterations and asymptotically. We also address finite-precision issues, making it practical to use in bfloat16. When integrated into the Muon training framework, our method leads to consistent improvements in validation loss when training a GPT-2 model on one billion tokens from the FineWeb dataset, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.},

We prove that, using $O(k \log(N/k))$ matrix-vector products and $O(Nk^2 \log(N/k))$ additional runtime, the algorithm returns an HSS matrix $\mathbf B$ with rank-$k$ blocks whose expected Frobenius norm error $\mathbb E[\|\mathbf A - \mathbf B\|^2_F]$ is at most $O(\log(N/k))$ times worse than the best possible approximation error by an HSS rank-$k$ matrix. In fact, the algorithm we analyze in a simple modification of an empirically effective method proposed by Levitt & Martinsson [SISC 2024]. As a stepping stone towards our main result, we prove two results that are of independent interest: a similar guarantee for a variant of the algorithm which accesses A's entries directly, and explicit error bounds for near-optimal subspace approximation using projection-cost-preserving sketches. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis constitutes the first polynomial-time quasi-optimality result for HSS matrix approximation, both in the explicit access model and the matrix-vector product query model.},

This family captures problems like evaluating Boolean formulas and multi-step word problems. Assuming standard hardness assumptions from circuit complexity and communication complexity, we prove that none of these three architectures is capable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension, and number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the input $n$. We also provide a construction for each architecture that solves CRQs. For transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the problem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and sufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. (Otherwise, a linear dimension is necessary). For transformers with chain of thought, our construction uses $n$ CoT tokens. These results show that, while CRQs are inherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to overcome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture has strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.},

    abstract = {The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input pairs, without imposing a locality bias for neighboring tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention. Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or locality biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention.},

However, hyperparameters such as the rank of the attention matrices and the number of heads are scaled nearly the same way in all realizations of this architecture, without theoretical justification. In this work we show that there are dramatic trade-offs between the rank and number of heads of the attention mechanism. Specifically, we present a simple and natural target function that can be represented using a single full-rank attention head for any context length, but that cannot be approximated by low-rank attention unless the number of heads is exponential in the embedding dimension, even for short context lengths. Moreover, we prove that, for short context lengths, adding depth allows the target to be approximated by low-rank attention. For long contexts, we conjecture that full-rank attention is necessary. Finally, we present experiments with off-the-shelf transformers that validate our theoretical findings.},

We describe a simple randomized algorithm that returns an approximation with the given sparsity pattern with Frobenius-norm error at most $(1+\epsilon)$ times the best possible error. When each row of the desired sparsity pattern has at most $s$ nonzero entries, this algorithm requires $O(s/\epsilon)$ non-adaptive matrix-vector products with $\mathbf A$. We also prove a matching lower-bound, showing that, for any sparsity pattern with $\Theta(s)$ nonzeros per row and column, any algorithm achieving $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation requires $\Omega(s/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products in the worst case. We thus resolve the matrix-vector product query complexity of the problem up to constant factors, even for the well-studied case of diagonal approximation, for which no previous lower bounds were known.},

For the function $\mathbf A^{-1}$, it is known that the error of Lanczos-FA after $k$ iterations matches the error of the best approximation from the Krylov subspace of degree $k$ when $\mathbf A$ is positive definite. We prove that the same holds, up to a multiplicative approximation factor, when $f$ is a rational function with no poles in the interval containing $\mathbf A$'s eigenvalues. The approximation factor depends the degree of $f$'s denominator and the condition number of $\mathbf A$, but not on the number of iterations $k$. Experiments confirm that our bound accurately predicts the convergence of Lanczos-FA. Moreover, we believe that our result provides strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance that has long by observed of the Lanczos method, both for approximating rational functions and functions like $\mathbf A^{1/2} \mathbf b$ that are well approximated by rationals.},

    abstract = {Modeling the distribution of high-dimensional data by a latent tree graphical model is a prevalent approach in multiple scientific domains. A common task is to infer the underlying tree structure, given only observations of its terminal nodes. Many algorithms for tree recovery are computationally intensive, which limits their applicability to trees of moderate size. For large trees, a common approach, termed divide-and-conquer, is to recover the tree structure in two steps. First, separately recover the structure of multiple, possibly random subsets of the terminal nodes. Second, merge the resulting subtrees to form a full tree. Here, we develop spectral top-down recovery (STDR), a deterministic divide-and-conquer approach to infer large latent tree models. Unlike previous methods, STDR partitions the terminal nodes in a non random way, based on the Fiedler vector of a suitable Laplacian matrix related to the observed nodes. We prove that under certain conditions, this partitioning is consistent with the tree structure. This, in turn, leads to a significantly simpler merging procedure of the small subtrees. We prove that STDR is statistically consistent and bound the number of samples required to accurately recover the tree with high probability. Using simulated data from several common tree models in phylogenetics, we demonstrate that STDR has a significant advantage in terms of runtime, with improved or similar accuracy.},

Using the model, we prove that if the traffic pattern is "interference-free", there exists a unique optimal design that both minimizes maximum flow completion time and yields maximal system-wide throughput. We show that interference-free patterns correspond to the important set of patterns that display data locality properties and use these theoretical insights to study three widely used interconnects --- fat-trees, folded-Clos and dragonfly topologies. We derive equations that describe the optimal design for each interconnect as a function of the traffic pattern. Our model predicts, for example, that a 3-level folded-Clos interconnect with radix 24 that routes 10% of the traffic through the spine links can reduce the number of switches and cabling at the core layer by 25% without any performance penalty. We present experiments using production TCP/IP code to empirically validate the results and provide tables for network designers to identify optimal designs as a function of the size of the interconnect and traffic pattern.},

abstract = { A common assumption in multiple scientific applications is that the distribution of observed data can be modeled by a latent tree graphical model. An important example is phylogenetics, where the tree models the evolutionary lineages of a set of observed organisms. Given a set of independent realizations of the random variables at the leaves of the tree, a key challenge is to infer the underlying tree topology. In this work we develop spectral neighbor joining (SNJ), a novel method to recover the structure of latent tree graphical models. Given a matrix that contains a measure of similarity between all pairs of observed variables, SNJ computes a spectral measure of cohesion between groups of observed variables. We prove that SNJ is consistent and derive a sufficient condition for correct tree recovery from an estimated similarity matrix. Combining this condition with a concentration of measure result on the similarity matrix, we bound the number of samples required to recover the tree with high probability. We illustrate via extensive simulations that in comparison to several other reconstruction methods, SNJ requires fewer samples to accurately recover trees with a large number of leaves or long edges. },

abstract = {The Theory of Bottleneck Structures is a recently-developed framework for studying the performance of data networks. It describes how local perturbations in one part of the network propagate and interact with others. This framework is a powerful analytical tool that allows network operators to make accurate predictions about network behavior and thereby optimize performance. Previous work implemented a software package for bottleneck structure analysis, but applied it only to toy examples. In this work, we introduce the first software package capable of scaling bottleneck structure analysis to production-size networks. Here, we benchmark our system using logs from ESnet, the Department of Energy's high-performance data network that connects research institutions in the U.S. Using the previously published tool as a baseline, we demonstrate that our system achieves vastly improved performance, constructing the bottleneck structure graphs in 0.21 s and calculating link derivatives in 0.09 s on average. We also study the asymptotic complexity of our core algorithms, demonstrating good scaling properties and strong agreement with theoretical bounds. These results indicate that our new software package can maintain its fast performance when applied to even larger networks. They also show that our software is efficient enough to analyze rapidly changing networks in real time. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying bottleneck structure analysis to solve practical problems in large, real-world data networks.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
