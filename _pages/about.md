I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at NYU. I'm advised by [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) and [Chris Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com) and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My main research interests are fast algorithms for scientific computing and the theory of deep learning. 

Previously, I was a research engineer at [Reservoir Labs](https://www.reservoir.com/) (now Qualcomm) working on modeling congestion control in communication networks and on non-convex optimization. Before that, I was an undergrad at Yale, where I was advised by [Bob Frank](https://bobfrank1.github.io/) and [Dan Spielman](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/). I was a member of the [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/) lab, and I spent a summer at the Weizmann Institute working on phylogenetic inference with [Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home) and [Ariel Jaffe](https://arieljaffe.huji.ac.il/).
